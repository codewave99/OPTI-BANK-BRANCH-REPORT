# OPTI-BANK-BRANCH-REPORT
This project analyzes JPMorgan Chase’s physical branch distribution across US states relative to population concentration, highlighting coverage gaps and optimization opportunities. Despite the rise of digital banking, physical branches remain vital for advisory services, documentation, and relationship management

Overview
OPTIBRANCH analyzes JPMorgan Chase’s physical branch distribution across US states relative to population concentration, uncovering coverage gaps and optimization opportunities. Despite the growth of digital banking, physical branches remain essential for advisory services, documentation, and relationship management, especially in suburban and rural areas.

This project uses publicly available FDIC branch location data and US ZIP-level resident counts, combined with Python-based analytics, to evaluate how effectively JPMorgan Chase allocates branches relative to state populations. The analysis identifies over-served and under-served states and provides actionable recommendations for strategic branch network optimization.

Features
Data cleaning and merging of branch and population datasets
Calculation of key metrics: total branches, total population, people per branch
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with histograms, heatmaps, boxplots, and bar charts
Feature engineering including ranking and coverage flags
Automated Excel report generation with formatted tables and embedded charts
Visualizations saved as images for easy sharing
Identification of states with branch coverage gaps or saturation
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash

Run
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/optibranch.git
cd optibranch
Install required Python packages (preferably in a virtual environment):
bash

Run
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn openpyxl
Place the input datasets in the project directory:
SOD_CustomDownload_ALL_2024_06_30.csv (FDIC branch locations)
uszips.csv (ZIP-level resident counts)
Usage
Run the main analysis script (e.g., optibranch_analysis.py):

bash

Run
Copy code
python optibranch_analysis.py
This will:

Load and clean data
Merge datasets and calculate metrics
Generate an Excel report jpmorgan_branch_population_analysis.xlsx with formatted tables and charts
Save visualizations as PNG images
Print key findings and insights to the console
Key Findings
Under-served states: Utah, Nevada, Idaho, Arizona (high people per branch)
Over-served states: New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania (dense branch networks)
Some low-population states have disproportionately high branch counts, indicating inefficiencies.
Recommendations
Expand branch coverage in high-growth, under-served states
Align branch planning with 2025–2030 population projections and migration trends
Consider consolidating branches in over-saturated regions to reduce costs
Use data-driven reviews annually for continuous optimization
